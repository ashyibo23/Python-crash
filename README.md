# Python-crash
Python Tutorial

Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

Expected to have some experience with Python and numpy; for the rest of this section will serve as a quick crash course both on the Python programming language and on the use of Python for scientific computing.

Some of you may have previous knowledge in Matlab, in which case it's recommended the numpy for Matlab users page (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

In this tutorial, it's covered:

* Basic Python: Basic data types (Containers, Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples), Functions, Classes
* Numpy: Arrays, Array indexing, Datatypes, Array math, Broadcasting
* Matplotlib: Plotting, Subplots, Images
* IPython: Creating notebooks, Typical workflows
